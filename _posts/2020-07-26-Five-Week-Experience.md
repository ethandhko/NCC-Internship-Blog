## Week 1

Now more than ever, multi-omics data has become imperative to understanding cancer and its mechanisms. 
Therefore, week 1 was generally spent getting comfortable with the idea of proteomics and multi-omics data along with its implications on modern science.

I spent a majority of my time attempting to understand what this type of data looked like, as I had never been exposed to it before.
It involved a lot of researaching, scrolling through data, and attempting to understand visualizations.

## Week 2

Week 2 was when I really began diving deeper into data analysis.
Through trial and error, I downloaded the OmiEmbed software onto my computer.
The installation process was a lot more difficult than I had expected, as there were many supplementary softwares I needed to download, as well as errors that I ran into.
Therefore, to help others out in their future OmiEmbed installation endeavors, I created a step-by-step guide on how to install the software on my [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/ncc-blog-ethan-ko/home).
After installation, I tested out running the train_test files on my computer, which I was able to produce some visualizations with.
Mr.Kim was able to teach me more about the importance of train and test files, and its importance for machine learning.

I also began to branch out into my own reserach topic which surrounded cancer metastasis in thyroid cancer.
I am currently writing and publishing a research paper on the effect of radiotherapy on distant metastsis in papillary thyroid cancer. 
To connect my internship experience and my writing together, I decided that by engaging in multi-omics data analysis around cancer metastsis in thyroid cancer would be helpful to my research.

## Week 3

During Week 3, Mr.Kim gave us the task to engage in exploratory data anlysis for datasets from the PDC and a [Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30342-3).
Firstly, I began to research what exploratory data anlysis was. I learned that it meant to expose yourself to unfamiliar data and attempt to understand it through investigating patterns, anomalies, and testing hypotheses.

To carry out this task, I began to learn how to use Pandas. Pandas is an application that assists with data cleaning and manipulation. It also provides efficient visualizations of data.
In order to learn and get comfortable with Pandas' numerous commands, I created a Pandas command list that I uploaded in my previous blog, and on my [Google Site](https://sites.google.com/view/ncc-blog-ethan-ko/home).
By learning how to use pandas to analyze data, I was able to spot patterns in data that I presented in my week 3 presentation.

Overall, this week consisted of exploratory data anlysis of unfamiliar datasets using Pandas.

## Week 4

Mr.Kim gave us the task of uploading datasets from CPTAC onto Omics Playground.
Omics Playground is a software that creates and displays efficient and clear visualizations for data analysts. 
However, the upload process for Omics Playground is rigorous, requiring sample and counts data in the form of .csv. 
Majority of this week was spent attempting to upload CPTAC datasets to Omics Playground. Eventually, after several forms of data cleaning and editing, I was able to upload the CPTAC Glioblastoma dataset to Omics Playground (see screenshot below).

In addition to uploading the data to Omics Playground, I documented my progress and provided a step-by-step guide to uploading the data on my week 4 presentation.
