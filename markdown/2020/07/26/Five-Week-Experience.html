<p>This blog post provides a brief overview of my five week experience in the NCC Internship program.
I provide details of what I achieved each week, and overall takeaways from the experience as a whole.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#week-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B1If5Bvh-s6tBPojnhCGpyM8s_lRUj-QWLMT5C5Rnds/edit?usp=sharing">Week 1</a>
</h2>

<p>Now more than ever, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multi-omics data</code> has become imperative to understanding cancer and its mechanisms. 
Therefore, week 1 was generally spent getting comfortable with the idea of proteomics and multi-omics data along with its implications on modern science.</p>

<p>I spent a majority of my time attempting to understand what this type of data looked like, as I had never been exposed to it before.
It involved a lot of researaching, scrolling through data, and attempting to understand visualizations.</p>

<h2 id="week-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#week-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f1P7xcVEUgjvskjVmk88OkLYYI7-0to4qn3xFUEnHmc/edit?usp=sharing">Week 2</a>
</h2>

<p>Week 2 was when I really began diving deeper into data analysis.
Through trial and error, I downloaded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OmiEmbed</code> software onto my computer. This software assists with multi-task deep learning of datasets.
The installation process was a lot more difficult than I had expected, as there were many supplementary softwares I needed to download, as well as errors that I ran into. Therefore, to help others out in their future OmiEmbed installation endeavors, I created a step-by-step guide on how to install the software on my <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ncc-blog-ethan-ko/home">Google Site</a>.</p>

<p>After installation, I tested out running the train_test files on my computer, which I was able to produce some visualizations with.
Mr.Kim was able to teach me more about the importance of train and test files, and its importance for machine learning.
<img src="/NCC-Internship-Blog/images/omi.png" alt="" title="OmiEmbed train_test Visualizations"></p>

<p>I also began to branch out into my own reserach topic which surrounded cancer metastasis in thyroid cancer.
I am currently writing and publishing a research paper on the effect of radiotherapy on distant metastsis in papillary thyroid cancer. 
To connect my internship experience and my writing together, I decided that by engaging in multi-omics data analysis around cancer metastsis in thyroid cancer would be helpful to my research.</p>

<h2 id="week-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#week-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10OcXNKOwkRgpm4Dtl4W-p-_doRcUtU3KTCY_ki_K_Cw/edit?usp=sharing">Week 3</a>
</h2>

<p>During Week 3, Mr.Kim gave us the task to engage in exploratory data anlysis for datasets from the PDC and a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30342-3">Nature article</a>.
Firstly, I began to research what exploratory data anlysis was. I learned that it meant to expose yourself to unfamiliar data and attempt to understand it through investigating patterns, anomalies, and testing hypotheses.</p>

<p>To carry out this task, I began to learn how to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pandas</code>. Pandas is an application that assists with data cleaning and manipulation. It also provides efficient visualizations of data.
In order to learn and get comfortable with Pandas’ numerous commands, I created a Pandas command list that I uploaded in my previous blog, and on my <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ncc-blog-ethan-ko/home">Google Site</a>.
By learning how to use pandas to analyze data, I was able to spot patterns in data that I presented in my week 3 presentation. Though the analysis wasn’t very deep or intricate, it was still a great introduction for me to learn more about exploratory data anlysis and its importance.</p>

<h2 id="week-4">
<a class="anchor" href="#week-4" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_Qnu0JGPnFFiXBcDsDZxGLfdcLUV_Oy4YZzJiUuO7dY/edit?usp=sharing">Week 4</a>
</h2>

<p>Mr.Kim gave us the task of uploading datasets from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CPTAC</code> onto <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Omics Playground</code>.
Omics Playground is a software that creates and displays efficient and clear visualizations for data analysts. 
However, the upload process for Omics Playground is rigorous, requiring sample and counts data in the form of .csv. 
Majority of this week was spent attempting to upload CPTAC datasets to Omics Playground. Eventually, after several forms of data cleaning and editing, I was able to upload the CPTAC Glioblastoma dataset to Omics Playground (see screenshot below).</p>

<p>In addition to uploading the data to Omics Playground, I documented my progress and provided a step-by-step guide to uploading the data on my week 4 presentation and in my <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ncc-blog-ethan-ko/home">Google Site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="week-5">
<a class="anchor" href="#week-5" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 5</h2>

<p>The final week of this internship was arguably the most difficult of all.</p>

<p>The first task I was given based on Mr.Kim’s feedback of week 4’s progress was to edit the glioblastoma data to only include positive values, and to upload it to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Omics Playground</code>. Originally, the mean of the data was set to zero, therefore the data included many negative values.
After changing the values to all be positive, and analyzing the visuals on Omics Playground, I found that the clustered heatmaps of each exhibited drastically different visuals.</p>

<p><img src="/NCC-Internship-Blog/images/gbm.png" alt="" title="Clustered Heatmaps of Glioblastoma Data"></p>

<p>I noticed that the updated data was much smoother in contrast between the original data that displays jagged changes in blue and red. After doing additional reserach, I was able to find that it is better to have all data values positive, as in some cases it provides more accurate visualizations.</p>

<p>The second task I had was to combine all the CPTAC datasets together and run them through OmiEmbed. This is where I sadly ran into my one and only error of the week: concatenation error.</p>

<p><img src="/NCC-Internship-Blog/images/error.png" alt="" title="Concatenation Error"></p>

<p>Despite searching through numerous Stack Overflow forums and online tutorials, I wasnt’ able to find a solution to this.
Although the internship is ending, I am still determined to get the datasets working and be able to run them through OmiEmbed.</p>

<p>The last and most grueling task I faced was this blog post.
Before this week, I had no idea that blog posts in data science were this complicated to create.</p>

<p>I am currently using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fastpages</code> to create this blog. For this post, I am using a markdown format so that I can easily add text and images.
For my Pandas Commands post, I used Jupyter Notebook so that I could display the input and output of the commands for readers. To make the post look cleaner, I used the collapse-output feature so that readers could choose to view the output of the commands if they wished to.</p>

<p>Through numerous tutorials, trial and errors, and hours of confusion, I feel comfortale using fastpages to upload blog posts.
I will definitely be using this template once again if I make another data science blog in the future.</p>
